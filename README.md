Package sidx includes a number of helpers to extend slice indexing to negative indices.

Index calculates positive and negative indices allowing 0 for the first element as usual or -1 for the last (and -2 for the second to last, etc.). N is a more convenient form, for the common case of a slice. Everything else in this package is a wrapper around N for common cases.

At(s, i) is s\[N(s, i)] and End is short for At(s, -1). AtOk is a the comma-ok version of At. AtOr is similar to AtOk but it returns a default value when the index is invalid.

Slice is a 2 value slice where the start and end are calculated by N.

Pop(s) returns, clears, and slices off At(s, -1).
